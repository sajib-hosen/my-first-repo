        <H5 style="font-size: 20px;">Why does Superman wear underwear outside?</H5>
        <p>Originally Answered: Why does Superman wear his underwear on the outside? Superman probably wore his underwear on the outside because he either loved the idea of flaunting his red colored underpants or he was scared of sweating and irritation down there because of work load</p>

        <h3>why does batman wear his underwear on the outside?</h3>
        <p>Because he is a copy of Superman. Superman used to wear underwear outside his pant, so his copy did so too. Batman was created directly following Superman's success and the mission statement that the then National Comics(DC Comics) had while creating him was to make a second Superman</p>
